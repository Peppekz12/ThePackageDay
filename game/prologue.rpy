  "Prologue"

  "The Package Day."

  "A beautiful day to witness and experience. It started out for soldiers to have one day to see their letters of loved ones."

  "Over time it naturally developed into an international holiday"

  "Sending packages to loved ones."

  "No matter how far away they are."

  "You can still feel the connection between you through a package."

  "Well…"

  "If you {i}would {/i}get one."

  "For those unlucky ones like me,"

  "It’s just another free day off work."

  "Sure, most have someone to get packages from. Friends, family, maybe even lovers."

  "I  don’t have that kind of luxury."

  "My family hasn’t bothered to contact me since I came out."

  "There’s not much time to find a lover whilst your family is busy disowning you, so that’s out too."

  "And friends…"

  "Well, there {i}is{/i} {b}Andreas{/b}{b}.{/b}"

  "But a job like his makes it impossible for him to enjoy the day."

  "Deliverymen don’t get Package Day off."

  "Every Deliveryman is forced to work today. Some packages even get delayed."

  "Just to get it delivered on this particular day."

  "… "

  "Maybe I should visit him."

  "We’ve enjoyed each other\'s company since we were kids, so maybe I can help him out."

  "I had no plans today, {u}anyway{/u}."

  "{i}Look over his staple of porn magazines of {/i}{i}muscular men{/i}{i}.{/i}"

  raph "Yeah not today."

  "I put on some clothes out of my cabin that seem decent. "

  raph "Sometimes I wonder if I should care a little more about fashion."

  "{i}From a different perspective. The ram seems like someone {/i}{i}threw up a bunch of colors onto him.{/i}"

  raph "Yeah, seems fine to me."

  "{i}The awfully dressed ram made his way to the delivery office.{/i}"

  "{i}He arrives at an office {/i}{i}with a lot{/i}{i} of people {/i}{i}coming {/i}{i}in{/i}{i} and out.{/i}"

  "{i}People {/i}{i}seem either{/i}{i} happy with a package or letter in their hand going out,{/i}"

  "{i}Or mad about not getting what they wanted.{/i}"

  "{i}Some even come {/i}{i}out {/i}{i}looking sad.{/i}"

  raph "Well, crap…"

  raph "I gotta squeeze through this somehow."

  raph "{i}sigh{/i}"

  "{i}The still awfully dressed ram tries to {/i}{i}squish{/i}{i} through{/i}{i} the crowd to get {/i}{i}to{/i}{i} the counter.{/i}"

  "{i}As the ram comes closer and closer to the inside of the office;{/i}"

  "{i}The noises{/i}{i},{/i}{i} complaints, {/i}{i}and {/i}{i}screams get louder and louder{/i}{i}.{/i}"

  "{i}And as he {/i}{i}approaches the{/i}{i} middle of the crowd{/i}{i},{/i}"

  "{i}The ram spots a muscular purple dragon, adorned with small horns, behind the counter.{/i}"

  "{i}He’s juggling dealing with packages and customers, seemingly on his own.{/i}"

  "{i}Yeah that’s {/i}{i}Andreas{/i}{i} for you.{/i}"

  "{i}Always trying to do everything at once.{/i}"

  "{i}If he wasn’t so buff, it would have caused {/i}{i}him {/i}{i}a lot of issues.{/i}"

  "But the ram doesn’t mind that about him " "{i}But the ram doesn’t mind that {/i}{i}about him{/i}{i} {/i}{i}3{/i}"

  "{i}The ram can’t help but absentmindedly leak a little saliva out of his mouth.{/i}"

  "{i}You see {/i}{i}Andreas{/i}{i} getting more and more frustrated with all the packages and {/i}{s}{i}the{/i}{/s}{i} customers.{/i}"

  "{i}Then at one moment.{/i}"

  "{i}He sees you.{/i}"

  andreas "Ralph?"

  "{i}As soon as he sees the ram.{/i}"

  "{i}He seems a bit ashamed.{/i}"

  "{i}But right after that he {/i}{s}{i}points {/i}{/s}{s}{i}with his body to a door.{/i}{/s}{i} makes a gesture to a door {/i}{i}behind {/i}{i}him.{/i}"

  "{i}It seems to lead outside.{/i}"

  "{i}But the ram doesn’t know that.{/i}"

  "{i}The ram rather seems confused.{/i}"

  "{i}The dragon looks at you a bit angrily and as if he wanted to move to the right.{/i}"

  "{i}He crashed {/i}{i}into {/i}{i}another{/i}{i} deliveryman.{/i}"

  "{i}You see the dragon having a short shock at the moment.{/i}"

  "{i}This is gonna hurt.{/i}"

  "{i}Physically and emotionally.{/i}"

  "{i}All the packages that he had in his hand suddenly flew above the counter.{/i}"

  "{i}Andreas {/i}{i}probably regrets {/i}{i}the last couple {/i}{i}choices he made.{/i}"

  "{i}Damaging packages on this very day?{/i}"

  "{i}B{/i}{i}ad idea for his future career.{/i}"

  "{i}Unexpectedly, a few quick-moving shadows  appear.{/i}"

  "{i}The packages that flew above the counter.{/i}"

  "{i}The first one suddenly is placed on the left.{/i}"

  "{i}The second one to the middle,{/i}"

  "{i}And the last one to the right.{/i}"

  "{i}A big {/i}{i}pump {/i}{i}can be heard.{/i}"

  "{i}The dragon landed on the floor.{/i}"

  "{i}The sound stops all the talking in the room.{/i}"

  "{i}The ram seems distressed about {/i}{i}the dragon{/i}{i}.{/i}"

  raph "RaphaelAndreas!!!"

  "{i}The ram tries to run over {/i}{i}to{/i}{i} the counter, but gets blocked. {/i}"

  "{i}The shadow{/i}{s}{i}s{/i}{/s}{i} that stapled the packages to the counter?{/i}"

  "{i}It was a fox.{/i}"

  "{i}A fox with brown-yellow fur and a {/i}{i}menacing{/i}{i} look.{/i}"

  question_boss "What do you think you’re doing?"

  "{i}She now sits on the counter, still blocking the way.{/i}"

  question_boss "Andreas!"

  question_boss "Stand up!"

  "{i}Andreas {/i}{i}appears{/i}{i} {/i}{i}to {/i}{i}have {/i}{s}{i}withstand{/i}{/s}{i} withstood{/i}{i} the landing quite well.{/i}"

  "{i}The dragon slowly starts to stand up to his two {/i}{i}feet{/i}{s}{i}s{/i}{/s}{i}.{/i}"

  question_boss "I really don’t think you’re suited for this kind of work today, of all days."

  andreas "But Boss!"

  boss "No. Today is way too important to slack on."

  boss "Package Day is too much of a priority to let stupid mistakes happen."

  boss "You’re on package delivery today! Understood?"

  andreas "Yes, Boss…"

  boss "And another thing, all our cars already went out, so you’ll have to use yours."

  boss "And tell you what, you won’t have to worry about fuel. I’ll make sure the Company will chalk up anything you drive today as necessary expenses."

  boss "But only if you make today’s deliveries on time and without any more problems."

  boss "Do I make myself clear?"

  andreas "Yes, Boss!"

  "{i}The fox turns to look at you.{/i}"

  boss "Looks like you two know each other."

  "Oh no."

  "{i}After a dressing down like that from her, the ram’s sweating bullets, and now she’s talking to him.{/i}"

  "{i}And with a gaze that could kill a whale.{/i}"

  "{i}M{/i}{i}oby Dick couldn’t withstand such a glare.{/i}"

  boss "Could you do me a favor?"

  boss "Take Andreas for a little breather. I think he needs it after that fall."

  boss "I’ll give him a break of 5 or 10 minutes. After that I want to see him in the car."

  boss "Understood?"

  raph "RaphaelYes, Boss!"

  "{i}The fox didn’t seem to expect him to follow her orders so easily.{/i}"

  "{i}She {/i}{i}failed to hide a small giggle.{/i}"

  "{i}But her giggle doesn’t last long.{/i}"

  "{i}She comes back to her {/i}{i}menacing{/i}{i} gaze and shouts.{/i}"

  boss "AND ALL OF YOU HERE!"

  "{i}The crowd {/i}{i}is completely{/i}{i} taken aback{/i}{i} by this scream.{/i}"

  boss "START FORMING LINES OR YOU’LL NEVER GET YOUR PACKAGE. WE’RE HUMAN TOO."

  "{i}The crowd {/i}{i}would never refuse{/i}{i} her order {/i}{i}after that {/i}{i}and {/i}{i}carefully {/i}{i}gather into strictly formed lines in front of the counter.{/i}"

  "{i}Meanwhile t{/i}{i}he fox{/i}{i}’s{/i}{i} gaze comes shortly back to you.{/i}"

  boss "I didn’t think anyone would make me laugh today."

  "{i}Her face loosens up and loses some, but not all, of her intimidation.{/i}"

  "{i}She isn’t really smiling, but the {/i}{i}ram {/i}{i}could{/i}{i} feel that she{/i}{i}’{/i}{i}s not as upset anymore.{/i}"

  boss "Mind checking on Andreas? He’s one of my best workers."

  boss "Could you ask him if he hurt himself in that fall?"

  boss "He’d never tell me."

  boss "After all, I run things here. On the most important day of any delivery office."

  "{i}The ram is a little stunned by her words.{/i}"

  "Wow… I really couldn’t think for myself for a second."

  "Her presence is just too imposing to ignore."

  "{i}He gathers himself up.{/i}"

  raph "RaphaelI think I can do it, Boss!"

  "{i}The ram didn’t realize that he didn\'t need to call her that.{/i}"

  "{i}…but only{/i}{i} after he said this sentence.{/i}"

  "{i}How much can one ram sweat from embarrassment, I wonder?{/i}"

  "{i}The fox {/i}{i}again {/i}{i}couldn’t resist giggling and looked up to him.{/i}"

  boss "Thank you."

  "{i}As if from nowhere, she gives a look of real happiness.{/i}"

  "{i}The ram didn’t expect to have the gaze of the boss look so full of gratitude towards him.{/i}"

  boss "Even if you look like you just got back from the circus."

  "!!!"

  "{i}The ram feels like he was hit with an arrow to his thin chest.{/i}"

  boss "But the circus has a charm of its own, doesn’t it?"

  "{i}She {/i}{i}walk{/i}{i}s{/i}{i} away from the ram {/i}{i}and {/i}{i}goes{/i}{i} back{/i}{i} to command{/i}{i}ing{/i}{i} the other workers.{/i}"

  "…"

  "That woman is really something…"

  "…"

  "What was I here for again?"

  "…"

  "{i}The ram feels a sense of forgetting something important that happened moments ago.{/i}"

  "{i}The ram notices a door getting closed near him.{/i}"

  "Of course! Andreas!"

  "{i}The ram runs to the door that omits wind sounds.{/i}"

  "As he approaches the door."

  "Crap…"

  "It’s so cold."

  "…"

  "I should have brought a winter coat and not just a jacket for today."

  "{i}The ram overtook his own cowardness of cold and tried to open the door.{/i}"

  "{i}Opening the door emits a cold breeze to the ram.{/i}"

  "{i}He is not happy.{/i}"

  "I.."

  "really.."

  "regret…"

  "this"

  "{i}Well unhappy is an understatement.{/i}"

  "{i}The cold today is higher than usual, but a ram can withhold such cold{/i}"

  "{i}But not Raphael{/i}"

  "{i}Maybe it’s the clothes fault?{/i}"

  "{i}As the ram goes outside in the chilly morning.{/i}"

  "{i}He sees a dragon looking sad to the ground.{/i}"

  raph "What is it Andreas? The cold catching you?"

  andreas "Raising jokes in the cold windy outside? I didn’t think of you as a jockster."

  raph "Maybe I am one? Some people already describe me like I would come out of a circus."

  andreas "That would be a surprise to me. Aren’t you an office worker?"

  "{i}The ram is a bit fazed by the answer.{/i}"

  raph "That’s not the point! I would make a great clown!"

  andreas "Clown? Not Acrobat?"

  raph "Well you see my hands and feet."

  andreas "Oh yeah.."

  andreas "Hmm.."

  "The dragon seems to be going deep into thoughts."

  "An awkward silence sets in."

  "The ram sees this and reacts to it flustered."

  "He tries to break the silence."

  raph "I… eh"

  andreas "Hm?"

  raph "Why are there so many people here? I didn’t think that the delivery office is a hotspot for people. "

  andreas "My friend."

  andreas "You do know what the day is?"

  raph "Yes, Package Day."

  andreas "Sigh"

  andreas "It’s actually very simple."

  andreas "People sent packages to their loved ones."

  raph "Yes that’s what this whole day is about."

  andreas "But WHEN do people want to get the package?"

  raph "I assume on this day."

  andreas "You are correct."

  andreas "Fun fact"

  andreas "You can delay a package delivery time to be delivered today."

  andreas "But some people have a low trust to the delivery service"

  andreas "So they think it’s a great idea to only check TODAY if the package is there."

  andreas "As you can see. We have almost double the packages to deliver today AND deal with customers, who can’t be sure if there is a package for them…"

  raph "I am sorry to hear that.."

  "Ouch I didn’t think that this topic is such hot water for him"

  "Maybe I can.."

  raph "Is there anything that could help you all out?"

  andreas "Huh? Why do you ask so.."

  andreas "weirdly like a journalist?"

  raph "Eh…"

  andreas "Raph, don’t worry."

  andreas "There is a thing you or anyone else could do."

  raph "Oh! What would it be?"

  andreas "Just don’t píck the option to be delivered today."

  andreas "You can just tape on the package “Do not open until Package Day”."

  andreas "So the magic is still there, but now you don’t add more weight to the delivery office workers."

  "{i}The ram seems like he has learned a trick or two now.{/i}"

  "Andreas. Anyway, why are you here?"

  "{i}The ram didn’t expect this.{/i}"

  "He tries to find a decent explanation."

  raph "I"

  "{i}The dragon cuts him off.{/i}"

  andreas "Let me guess, Raph, you don’t have anyone for Package Day, so you went to your next best friend to find some enjoyment in a day off."

  "{i}The dragon has indeed shot a perfect bullseye.{/i}"

  raph "You know me too well.."

  "{i}The dragon breaks out a smile{/i}"

  andreas "You adorable ramy."

  "The dragon looks at his watch."

  andreas "I think I need to go now."

  andreas "Sigh."

  andreas "I hate car delivery…"

  raph "Why do you hate them so much?"

  andreas "You do be questioning a lot today."

  andreas "Did your quiz brain turn on or what?"

  raph "No, I am just genuinely curious."

  andreas "Alright.."

  "{i}The dragon blushes a bit.{/i}"

  andreas "I personally can not really deal with random people."

  "{i}The dragon sends a more nervous vibe towards the ram.{/i}"

  andreas "It’s a little embarrassing to admit."

  andreas "As a delivery person, I feel so nervous around new people."

  "The ram puts his hoof on his shoulder."

  raph "Don’t worry, you are doing great…"

  andreas "!"

  andreas "Thank you."

  raph "And perhaps you don’t need to do it alone."

  "The dragon has a curious look towards the ram, while the ram takes his arm off the dragon."

  andreas "How do you mean?"

  raph "Perhaps I can help you delivery today with the car."

  raph "It could be fun."

  andreas "Well you.."

  "The dragon seems to rethink something again."

  andreas "Actually, you can help me today."

  raph "Wait, really?"

  andreas "Yes!"

  andreas "Another fun fact"

  andreas "We take a lot of volunteers for today only."

  andreas "As you can see the overload of today. We can get any help we can."

  andreas "Would you be interested?"

  raph "Yes!"

  andreas "Great!"

  "The dragon suddenly throws at you some jiggling keys."

  andreas "Then you can drive the car today."

  raph "Eh wha..
The dragon interrupts the ram."

  andreas "Afterall, someone forgot to dress properly for such a day."

  "{i}The dragon looks at the awful clothing of the ram.{/i}"

  andreas "I will bring some uniform for your medium size. We will talk to a lot of different people today, are we?"

  raph "Yes…"

  andreas "Great! Now the car is parked at the very end. It’s a simple grey family car. The only one really.You can’t miss it. So you can drive towards the exit and we will meet there."

  andreas "Sounds like a plan."

  "{i}The ram just nods in agreement in his confusion.{/i}"

  "{i}The confusion isn’t helped by the cold that the ram feels more than ever.{/i}"

  "{i}The wind starts to get stronger as the cold.{/i}"

  "{i}The dragon goes back into the building.{/i}"

  "Man.."

  "He is sweet and shy."

  "Which makes him really adorable, but when it comes to work."

  "He can be as commanding as *her*."

  "But I had never seen his car before."

  "Call me intrigued."

  "Such a hunk has probably some gym equipment in the back and maybe"

  "*some spicy stuff*"

  "{i}The ram walks towards the car that the dragon described.{/i}"

  "It is a simple family car.."

  "Nothing out of the ordinary outside the car."

  "Let’s see inside. "

  "{i}The ram looked into the car\'s back window.{/i}"

  "As expected it’s just gym equipment or stuff related to it."

  "But it’s quite clean for an average worker."

  "Nothing spicy sadly " ",D"

  "{i}Disappointed, the ram walks towards the driver\'s door.{/i}"

  "{i}As he enters the car through the door by using the key that Andreas gave him.{/i}"

  "{i}He notices a little paper standing out of the car glove box.{/i}"

  "Oh what do we got here?"

  "{i}The ram naturally thought was to open the box, until{/i}"

  "Wait, maybe I shouldn’t do it."

  "Afterall he even gave me the keys to his car!"

  "Nobody would give those keys out without trusting them."

  "Isn’t opening such glove boxes a break of trust?"

  "{i}The ram thinks about this in a minute.{/i}"

  "I kinda wanna know, though."

  "I was already curious enough about his packages."

  "So why not this, too?"

  "{i}The ram opens the glove box{/i}"

  "{i}After the box gets opened a magazine comes out.{/i}"

  "{i}The ram jumps out of the excitement, even forgetting about the cold{/i}"

  "Oh my!"

  "He likes some touchy muscular man, too. "

  "But first."

  "{i}The ram gets into the car and starts the car.{/i}"

  "{i}To get warmth to his system from the cold.{/i}"

  "{i}The ram is getting more and more invested with the magazine that he forgets about time.{/i}"

  "…"

  "…"

  "…"

  "Oh I wished I could touch this.."

  "{i}The ram gets interrupted by a hard bonk on the car window.{/i}"

  andreas "Hey, why are you taking so long..?!"

  "{i}The dragon notices the magazine in the hands of the ram.{/i}"

  "{i}The dragon blushes as red as a tomato at the sight,{/i}"

  andreas "Open the door NOW!"

  "{i}The dragon steps into the passenger seat near the ram.{/i}"

  "{i}He quickly takes the magazine away from the ram.{/i}"

  andreas "Just.. drive."

  raph "Yes!"

  "{i}The ram tries to start the car, but first{/i}"

  andreas "Wait.."

  andreas "Here are some of the clothes that I got for you.."

  andreas "So please put them on quickly, ok?"

  "{i}The dragon can’t see straight to the eyes of the ram, while being still red in the face.{/i}"

  "{i}The ram quickly tries to change to the new uniform.{/i}"

  "{i}It doesn’t feel as comfortable as his old clothes, but now he isn’t looking like a fashion disaster.{/i}"

  andreas "Sigh…"

  andreas "Let’s not talk about this now."

  andreas "We are already late and we need to pick up the packages from the office real quick to not get a heavy delay."

  "{i}The ram silently drives with the car off to the office to get the packages to the car.{/i}"

  "{i}The dragon steps out of the car to get the packages.{/i}"

  "{i}Beforehand, the dragon has dropped a big notepad to the car (eh table idk?), which contains the notes and addresses of the packages. {/i}"

  "{i}The dragon quickly packs the car full with packages.{/i}"

  "{i}He is getting exhausted by the quick placing of all those boxes.{/i}"

  "{i}The dragon goes back to the car.{/i}"

  andreas "We are done…"

  andreas "Now we can do all the delivering."

  andreas "And please no more…"

  "The dragon gets red again"

  andreas "About that topic."

  "Prologue ends."
